        <h1>Act Report</h1>
        <p>Analysing and visualising data are the final stages to any data analysis process. Analysing the WeRateDogs dataset was a thrilling experience as it allowed us to garner precious insight from the data</p>
        <p> The data was gathered from three different sources after which it was cleaned and analysed.</p>
        <p> The project was a very fun one as it tested a lot of my skills as a data analyst. Those include:</p>
         <ul>
        <li>Downloading files programatically </li>
        <li>Querying an API</li>
        <li>Data Cleaning/Wrangling</li>
        <li>Data Analysis</li>
        <li>Data Visualisation</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Insights</h2>
        <p>Here are some insights I derived from the cleaned master dataset</p>
        <img src="pupper.jfif" alt="A picture of a pupper" >
        <p>
        <ul>
        <li>The average rating for a dog is 12/10. It might be shocking that the numerators are bigger than the denominators but WeRateDogs have a peculiar rating system where most ratings are greater than 10.</li>
        <li>Puppers are the dogs that are rated the most. Although most dogs dont have their stages identified, of those that do, Puppers have the highest count.</li>
        </li> Puppos have the highest average like per post. I guess people really love their puppos. They show this by liking their posts more than all the others</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
         <h2>Some other Insights</h2>
        <p>
        I went ahead to plot some information on charts so we can understand the trends so much easier. Come along as I share them with you. 
        </p>
        <h3>Histogram</h3>
        <img src="histogram.png" alt="A histogram" >
        <p>
        This histogram plots the distribution of ratings. We notice that most ratings fall between 1.0 and 1.4
        </p>
        <h3>Bar Chart</h3>
        <img src="bar_chart.png" alt="A histogram" >
        <p>
        This bar chart allows us see how many posts each dog type has. We observe visually that Puppers have the highest number of posts.
